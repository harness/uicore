# Introduction

This project is the implementation of [Next Generation UI Architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oe_cHcDyYhwjJ6QZqyOIlpUWGgYyeCIBfUOdElg2rBg/edit#heading=h.41cp29fl3vvn).

# Setup

All third-parties are defined as peer dependencies and not bundled into UICore build output. Consumers of UICore need to add by themselves.

UICore is published as a private package under [Harness GitHub Package Registry](https://github.com/orgs/wings-software/packages). You'll need to [follow instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-package-registry/about-github-package-registry) on Github to install it as a dependency.

UICore relies heavily on Blueprint. When using it as a dependency in your project, you'll need to add Blueprint as a dependency and import two CSS files.

```js
// Import in a .js(x)/.ts(x) file
import '@blueprintjs/core/lib/css/blueprint.css'
import '@blueprintjs/datetime/lib/css/blueprint-datetime.css'
import '@harness/uicore/dist/index.css'
```

```css
/* Import from a .css file  */
@import '@blueprintjs/core/lib/css/blueprint.css';
@import '@blueprintjs/datetime/lib/css/blueprint-datetime.css';
@import '@harness/uicore/styles';
```

You also need to import [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?selection.family=Inter) font. This font is currently used as Harness standard font.

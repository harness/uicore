# Colors

All colors are defined as global CSS variables. That means you can use the colors anywhere in your CSS and React inline styles without having to import.

As a matter of rule, no hex code should be used in any codebase. All colors must be defined in `colors.css` before they can be referred to.

To use a Color Reference, you'll need to import `Color`.

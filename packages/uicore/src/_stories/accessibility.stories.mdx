# Accessibility

Blueprint already provides accessible components out of the box. Many of the JS components will apply accessible HTML attributes to support different modes of usage.

UICore enhances Blueprint accessibility in two fronts:

- When a modal is opened, there is always focus on the first input element.
- Focus is trapped into a modal when it's opened. Meaning when you hit `Tab` when focus is on its last element, the focus will go back to the fist element instead of jumping out of the modal itself.

Focus outline should be always on when people using Tab to navigate and off when they use mouse. This behavior is done via Blueprint Accessibility API.

```ts
import { FocusStyleManager } from '@blueprintjs/core'

FocusStyleManager.onlyShowFocusOnTabs()
```
